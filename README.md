We are given a square grid of dimensions 2 Ã— 2 with origin as center. Now
we randomly throw 100 darts at the grid. We neglect the darts which land on the grid outside the
circle of radius 1 with origin as center. Now the distance of the dart landing closest to the center is
appended in a list. This complete simulation is performed 100000 times and the average minimum
distance is computed. Which turns out to be 0.088 each time!# Dart-Problem
